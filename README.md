# 2D-Shooter-Game
Simple 2D game to learn more of C++ and how to use Git

Working on it at simple pace.
Been fun so far.

To-do list:

	-Player respawn sequence
		-Revive player with invul stat
		-Set position to origin
		-Remove 1 life when killed
		-Add text for duration of wait (Text will depend if infinite lifes or not)
			If no lifes left, change text at last few frames saying GAME OVER
			(Maybe add HighScore file)
		-Add max lifes to Options
		-Give player almost double speed + halves fire rate if possible
			
	-Making the game fps independent
			
			
	//Greedy goals, not really a priority.
	-Add Intro with a quick simple logo
			
	-Implement sounds
			
	-Sway (Like continum) will be a power up
			
	-Make Gold Center the hitbox of player
	
	-Try HashMap for small collition detection
			
	-Add Drag to make movement smooth
