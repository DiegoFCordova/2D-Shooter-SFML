# 2D-Shooter-Game
Simple 2D game to learn more of C++ and how to use Git

Working on it at simple pace.
Been fun so far.

To-do list:

	-Player respawn
			
	-Making the game fps independent
			
			
	//Greedy goals, not really a priority.
	-Add Intro with a quick simple logo
			
	-Implement sounds
			
	-Sway (Like continum) will be a power up
			
	-Make Gold Center the hitbox of player
	
	-Try HashMap for small collition detection
			
	-Add Drag to make movement smooth
