# 2D-Shooter-Game
Simple 2D game to learn more of C++ and how to use Git

All goals I had in mind are complete! I will probably make
this into a full game in the future after I finish school
and learn more to improve my code.

Working on this game was pretty fun! Feel free to let me
know if there are parts that could be improved on, for I
am a newbiew when it comes to making complex things as games
on my own.

To-do list:

	//Greedy goals, not really a priority.
	-Add Drag to make movement smooth
	
	-Try HashMap for small collition detection
		
	-Implement sounds
	
	-Sway (Like continum) will be a power up
	
	-Levels & More Mobs
	
	-Using a file to keep track of high scores
	
	-Add Intro with a quick simple logo
