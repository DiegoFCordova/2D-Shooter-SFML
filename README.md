# 2D-Shooter-Game
Simple 2D game to learn more of C++ and how to use Git

Working on it at simple pace.
Been fun so far.

To-do list:
	-Make Star change patterns when changing difficulty.
			
	-Probably add Hud for UI "Game" state with player stats
	
	-Only render and update Game stuffs in their respective state.
			
	-Add "CanChange" cooldown to stars for Merciless to change stars properly
			
	-Player respawn
			
	-Add limit of wrap (loop in screen when offbounds) for bullets
			
			
	//Greedy goals, not really a priority.
	-Add Intro with a quick simple logo
			
	-Implement sounds
			
	-Sway (Like continum) will be a power up.
			
	-Make Gold Center the hitbox of player
	
	-Levels
